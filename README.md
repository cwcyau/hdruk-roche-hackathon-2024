# Health Data Research UK-Roche Hackathon

This hackathon is being convened by [Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk) in partnership with [Roche](http://www.roche.com) and enabled through [UKRI Turing AI Fellowship](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turing-artificial-intelligence-fellowships/turing-artificial-intelligence-fellowships) awarded to the lead organiser, [Professor Christopher Yau](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/team/christoper-yau) at the University of Oxford. It forms part of the immersion week series of the [HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/further-education/phd-programme/).

## What is the purpose of the Hackathon?

Following the success of the HDRUK-Roche Summer School in 2023, Health Data Research UK together with Roche are back this Spring 2024 for a new event! Our hackathon will involve talks by Roche, HDRUK scientists and group research activities. The theme of the hackathon will be "Protein Sequence Modelling". Prior knowledge of these areas is not a pre-requisite but participants should be competent programmers, have experience of analysing data and developing analytical methods.

## Internships

As part of the hackathon, participants will have an opportunity to submit follow-on work for competitive internships made exclusively available by Roche to HDRUK. Further information will be provided to participants at the hackathon.

## Who should apply?

The participants are expected to:

1. Be studying for a PhD in a substantively quantitative subject,
2. Have experience in biomedical or health data research,
3. Possess mature and competent scientific programming abilities in Python or R.

If you wish to apply for internships, you will need to be eligible to work in the UK, EU or Switzerland.

## How much will it cost me to attend?

Thanks to sponsorship by Roche and support from Health Data Research UK, we are able to offer the event with no registration fee. However, participants will be required to arrange their own transport and accommodation unless otherwise with HDRUK. A limited number of bursaries maybe available.

## Event Information

For registered participants, further information about the event is given [here](eventinfo.md).

## Cancellations

If circumstances beyond our control lead to an event cancellation for any reason, any registration fees will be refunded. However, participants should ensure they take out adequate personal insurance for any pre-booked travel as it is not possible for HDRUK to refund any incurred costs if a cancellation occurs.
