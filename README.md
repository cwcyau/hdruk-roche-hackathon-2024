# Health Data Research UK-Roche Hackathon

This summer school is being convened by [Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk) in partnership with [Roche](http://www.roche.com) and enabled through [UKRI Turing AI Fellowship](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turing-artificial-intelligence-fellowships/turing-artificial-intelligence-fellowships) awarded to the lead organiser, [Professor Christopher Yau](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/team/christoper-yau) at the University of Oxford. It forms part of the immersion week series of the [HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/careers-in-health-data-science/further-education/phd-programme/).

## What is the purpose of the summer school?

The purpose of this Summer School is to provide an intensive period of industry-led training in health data science. The featured topic of this summer school is **single-cell imaging analysis**. 

During the event, participants will be introduced to the scientific utility of spatial single-cell imaging analysis. You will learn about the biological questions that motivate the use of spatial single-cell analysis, the technologies allowing data to be acquired, and the workflow of data processing required to convert acquired images into research-ready molecular and cellular analysis datasets. There will be time for participants to work in small groups to explore some exemplar data sets and tackle some research questions under the guidance of Roche scientists.

## Internships

As part of the summer school, participants will have an opportunity to submit follow-on work for competitive internships made exclusively available by Roche to HDRUK. Further information will be provided to participants at the summer school.

## Who should apply?

The participants are expected to:

1. Be studying for a PhD in a substantively quantitative subject,
2. Have experience in biomedical or health data research,
3. Possess mature and competent scientific programming abilities in Python or R.

This summer school is unlikely to be suitable for those already with **direct** research experience of spatial single-cell analysis.

If you wish to apply for internships, you will need to be eligible to work in the UK, EU or Switzerland.

## How much will it cost me to attend?

Thanks to sponsorship by Roche and support from Health Data Research UK, we are able to offer the event available at minimal cost. 

Registration fees:

- HDRUK Wellcome PhD student (**free**)
- All other PhD students (**Â£100**)

Your registration fee will cover tuition, accommodation and a number of meals. If you are invited to participate, fees must be paid within 10 working days to ensure your place is secured. 

## How do I apply?

If you are interested in applying to participate in the summer school, please express your interest using the [registration form](https://forms.gle/1TKE4WMYMJ5TL92q9).

The deadline for applications is **30 May 2023**. **(REGISTRATION IS NOW CLOSED)**

After this date, applications will be screened for their basic eligibility and then places assigned randomly by lottery. A waiting list will be maintained for those who wish to be informed of withdrawals and late openings. There are a maximum of 16 (sixteen) places available.

Please note that during an earlier expression of interest call, the number of registrations vastly exceeded the number of available places so please ensure your applications are complete and entered by the end date.

## Event Information

For registered participants, further information about the event is given [here](eventinfo.md).

### Cancellations

If circumstances beyond our control lead to an event cancellation for any reason, any registration fees will be refunded. However, participants should ensure they take out adequate personal insurance for any pre-booked travel as it is not possible for HDRUK to refund any incurred costs if a cancellation occurs.
