# Skills you will need

The demonstration programs and code listings will use a combination of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Participants should familiarise themselves with programming with these languages in advance of the hackathon. We provide links to freely available resources below:

[The Hitchhikers Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/)
[Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning: Zero to Mastery book](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)
