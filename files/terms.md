# Saturn Cloud - Rules of Use

Saturn Cloud is an online based collaborative platform for data science.

HDRUK will be making use of this platform during the hackathon but participants can choose to use  their own computing facilities if preferred.

For Saturn Cloud users, the following rules apply:

1. Participants should ensure that they keep their HDRUK Saturn Cloud log-in details (user name and password) private. Log-in details should not be shared with anyone else.
2. The HDRUK Saturn Cloud account is to be used *only* for the purposes of the hackathon *only* as direceted by the Instructors. No other use is permitted.
3. Participants are able to access a range of compute resources within the HDRUK Saturn Cloud ranging in CPU/GPU power and memory which incur charges. Participants should use resources appropriate to their needs. Excessive use of high compute and large memory resources will not be permitted.
4. Participants maybe asked to limit the use of compute and memory resources within the HDRUK Saturn Cloud at any time by the Instructors and should act immediately if requested to do so.
5. Participants should not use the HDRUK Saturn Cloud outside of the designated period of the Hackathon unless instructed by HDRUK to as part of (i) the preparation for the event and (ii) authorised follow-up work.

Users who are deemed to be in violation of any of these rules may have their access revoked and be asked to leave the hackathon with immediate effect. 

Any participants discovered to be using the HDRUK Saturn Cloud for any malicious or criminal activity or any activity unrelated to the Hackathon will have their access immediately revoked. HDRUK reserves the right to investigate any such incidents and take appropriate action.
